          Undergraduate Degree and Transcripts: An undergraduate degree from a
          recognized post-secondary institution with a minimum B average in the
          last two full years (or equivalent) of academic work is required. Most
          Canadian business schools require a four-year degree, but in some
          cases, like Schulich School of Business, even a three-year degree is
          accepted. Always check with the individual schools. You will also
          require official transcripts to be sent directly from your
          post-secondary institution.

          Giving the GMAT or GRE is mandatory for most programs. However, some
          schools, such as the Rotman School of Management, offer a waiver to
          students who have passed all three levels of the CFA designation. The
          school will require a CFA confirmation of your CFA level 3 pass.
          Regarding the GMAT or GRE, there is no minimum score, but you can
          always check the average admission score for each school on their
          websites. The median GMAT score varies between 550 and 630. But if you
          want to get into competitive programs, you should aim for a score that
          is 20 to 30 points higher than the class average.

          Some universities, like McGill University, don’t require an English

          The minimum work experience requirement is two years, but the average
          is about 4 to 5 years. Universities often have their format for you to
          draft an MBA resume, and you are encouraged to follow those
          guidelines. It should cover your academic experience, work experience,
          membership in professional associations, community involvement, and

            Letters of Recommendation (LOR):
          </span>
          A LOR, or professional reference, helps the admissions committee gauge
          your performance and managerial potential. Some programs, such as the
          Rotman School of Management, may want professional recommendations
          from individuals who have worked with you in a close capacity. While
          others, such as the Schulich School of Business, may also allow an
          academic recommendation. Depending on the program, you must provide
          two to three individuals' names and email addresses

          The LOR should cover various aspects, such as your relationship with
          the referee, the responsibilities that you executed on the job or in
          academia, any achievements that stood out for the referee, what
          potential they see in you, and even the areas that they see future
          growth for you (presumably through an MBA in said esteemed
          university).

          Most business schools will ask you to answer two or three questions
          with varying word limits. For example, Ivey School of Business has
          three questions requiring 250-word answers. Recently, some business
          schools, such as Schulich School of Business, have added a video essay
          requirement in addition to the written ones. The Smith School of
          Business, on the other hand, requires a cover letter rather than an
          essay, along with two on-the-spot video questions and a written
          response. In timed- video essays, you will be asked to answer a
          question in writing. In contrast to the written essays submitted with
          the application, this short essay question (max. 250 words) is written
          with little time to deliberate. You will have up to five minutes to
          answer a question

          Your essays need to be well-structured and authentic. Admissions
          committees come across thousands of essays and can smell the bogus
          claims instantly. They look for interesting ideas, correct spelling,
          and proper syntax.

          Once your applications have been processed, certain schools might
          require an interview with the school officials. The intention is to
          gauge the compatibility of the applicant with the school. Questions
          revolve around your personal life, professional life, goals and
          aspirations, and the reasons for selecting a business school. A good
          MBA consultant can help prepare you for individual school interviews.
