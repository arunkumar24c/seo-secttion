        hough more popular among undergraduate students, MBA students may
        qualify to work off-campus during their studies. During vacations, you
        are eligible to work full-time. However, remember that the permit allows
        only 20 hours of work per week, and additional work hours would violate
        the visa. However, in 2022, facing nearly one million job vacancies, the
        Canadian government has eased this rule for now. This measure will allow
        over 500,000 eligible international students already in Canada to work
        more hours.

        Post-Graduate Work Permit
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#696969] mb-2">
        After graduating from a university, you can work in Canada on a Post
        Graduate Work Permit (PGWP). The only two criteria are:
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#696969] font-bold mb-1">
        1. Your university should be a Designated Learning Institute
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#696969] font-bold mb-5">
        2. Your program should be at least eight months long.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[#696969] mb-2">
        If you have studied for more than eight months and less than two years,
        then you will get PGWP for a duration like your program length. However,
        if you studied in a two-year program, you are eligible to work for three
        years. Even if you completed a two-year program earlier, you might still
        qualify for a three-year PGWP. All the top MBA programs in Canada are
        Designated Learning Institutes, and most graduates are eligible for a
        three-year work permit.
