          several program options for MBA applicants, allowing them to pursue
          their ambitions and interests. These curricular options include
          the Full-time MBA, the Executive MBA, and the joint MBA Law. You get
          to choose between their 48-credit (MBA General) and 54-credit (MBA
          Internship) programs, keeping in mind that every student begins at the
          same time and takes the same number of classes. The difference in
          credits comes down to the time you spend in the internship, not the
          classroom. The 48-credit program can be completed in 12 months. The
          54-credit takes 20 months, though many students accelerate it to
          finish in 16. Specializations allow students to tailor their studies
          to their career goals and interests. Students may choose from over 50
          management electives courses. An internship can be completed after the
          core. This MBA program offers specialization in finance, marketing,
          global strategy and leadership, business analytics, and
          entrepreneurship.
